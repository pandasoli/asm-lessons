### questions
- can 64-bit computer run x86 programs?  
  if not: why my x86 asm codes run?
- why do not we indent stuff inside sections
- what is the text section used for than just for `global _start`
- will the variables we create in `.data` and `.bss` really be in these sections in the memory

- lession 1
  - what is "the library"?
  - why `0Ah` have a "h" character? is it hexadecimal?
    if yes: why don't we use `0x` instead?
- lession 5
  - why do we have to use `ret` in the end of the `quit` function?

- lession 7
  - **what exactly are linefeeds?**: new line characters - `'\n'`

- lession 9
  - what is the difference between reserved in unreserved spaces in the memory?  
  I mean how my program knows that space is reserved?

- lession 22
  - what is that `o` in `0777o`?

- lession 23
  - why do I need root permission to read the created file?

- lession 29
  - what does `xor` means?
  - why `xor eax, eax` sets the `eax`'s value 0?
  - what is a socket?

- lession 36
  - if everything in Linux is a file, it means web sockets too... How would I handle web sockets in Windows if Windows doesn't deal with connections as they were files?
  - why we used in this class `0Dh, 0Ah` to create a new line instead of just `0Ah` (linefeed character)?
